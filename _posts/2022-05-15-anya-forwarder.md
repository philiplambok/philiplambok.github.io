Hello, I’m back! I know it’s been a long time. 

Today, I just want to share that I am currently building a new open-source application to help you manage your callbacks. It’s like https://webhook.site/ but it should be accessible without any Pro plan, so it’s always free!

It’s built with Rails 7 and would be using every build-in feature that is available in that release. Like Hotwire, Stimulus, and even the test would be written with Minitest.

It’s also would be my learning project, so I also will share any interesting things that I found when I built that application.

Here’s the demo for that application:

Here is the [URL for the application](https://anya-forwarder.herokuapp.com/), and this is for [the Github repository](https://github.com/philiplambok/anya). There is a lot that I want to add to this Application, like forwarder features, authentication for permanent URL, and all other things, so stay tuned!

That’s all for this post, thank you for reading!
