Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my blog, it’s the place where I share my ideas, something that I learned, and something that probably you don’t hate.

Currently, I'm a Ruby programmer at [Mekari](https://mekari.com/), assigned to their financial service team. I enjoy talking and discussing software reliability, maintainability, and how engineers collaborate to make software in fun ways.

If you found any interest in my articles, feel free to comment on the blog post or send me an email if you want. Here’s my email: philiplambok@gmail.com.

Enjoy reading!
