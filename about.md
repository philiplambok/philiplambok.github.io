Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my blog, it’s the place where I share my ideas, something that I learned, and something that probably you don’t hate.

Currently, I'm a Ruby programmer at [Mekari](https://mekari.com/), assigned to their financial service team. I enjoy talking and discussing software reliability, maintainability, and how engineers collaborate to make software in fun ways.

In my free time, i also sometimes write some open source tools like [Anya](https://github.com/philiplambok/anya), [a VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=philiplambok.vscode-rails-docs) to help jump into Rails doc, [A rails engine](https://github.com/philiplambok/realiser) to help storing setting data, [etc](https://github.com/philiplambok). 

If you found any interest in my articles, feel free to comment on the blog post or send me an email if you want. Here’s my email: philiplambok@gmail.com.

Enjoy reading!
